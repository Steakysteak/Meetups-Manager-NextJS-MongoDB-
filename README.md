# Meetups-Manager-NextJS-MongoDB-

Welcome to the Meetups Manager Project Site, a web application designed to help users organize and manage their meetups efficiently. The site is deployed using Vercel, a cloud platform for static and serverless deployment, and utilizes Next.js as the frontend and backend API framework, along with MongoDB Atlas as the database.

The Meetups Manager allows users to add new meetups, view details for existing meetups, and see a list of all meetups. Users can easily navigate through the site thanks to Next.js file-based routing, which provides a clear and organized structure for the backend API.

One of the key features of the Meetups Manager is its use of Next.js core concepts for page pre-rendering. The getStaticProps function is used to fetch data at build time and render static pages, which improves site performance and reduces load times. Additionally, getStaticPaths allows for dynamic routes to be generated at build time, while getServerSideProps is used for fetching data on a per-request basis. This combination of pre-rendering strategies provides a seamless user experience and improves overall site performance.

The Meetups Manager also utilizes MongoDB Atlas as the database, which allows for easy data storage and retrieval. The database is seamlessly integrated into the backend API, enabling users to easily add and retrieve information on their meetups.

Overall, the Meetups Manager Project Site showcases the power and versatility of Next.js, while providing a practical solution for managing and organizing meetups. Whether you're a professional event planner or simply looking to organize a casual get-together with friends, the Meetups Manager has got you covered.
